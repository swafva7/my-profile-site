    <h1>Your Name</h1>

    <p class="about">Hi, I am just someone trying to make sense of this life — not just through school or books, but through everything I feel and experience. I think a lot about
who I really am, beyond what others expect from me or the roles I’m supposed to play.
I genuinely enjoy learning — especially when it comes to deep ideas, science, math, and how the human mind works. I get inspired by strong women, bold dreams, and honest, real conversations.
I might seem quiet on the outside, but inside, my mind is full of questions, thoughts, and a deep need to grow. I believe in faith, in having purpose, and in slowly becoming the person I’m 
truly meant to be.
